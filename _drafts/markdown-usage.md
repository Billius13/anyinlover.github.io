> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

I have known Markdown for a year. First use the Marxico as a supplement of evernote. But today I want to find a freedom way to write technical articles. Because the jekyll's default markdown is Kramdown, and I research all the markdown syntaxs and find Kramdown is the most active and functional. So I just learn and review the basic syntaxs with the experience using Marxico.
