# Basic Concepts

## What is Classification

Classification is a form of data analysis that extracts models describing
important data classes.

Such models, called classifiers, predict categorical
(discrete, unordered) class labels.

Other models, called predictors, predict a continuous-valued function
or ordered value. (Regression analysis in statistic)

## General Approach to Classification

Two step:

1. Learning step
2. Classification step

Training set + Attribute vector --> Class label Attribute

* Supervised learning: the class label is provided
* Unsupervised learning: Clustering, the class label is not provided

A test set is needed because the classifier tend to overfit data.
